<h1 align="center"><strong>🌸 Waifu Generator 🌸</strong></h1>

- I built this project, which is a Waifu Generator that uses an API to generate waifus. I have to admit, I made it because I was really bored and wanted to do something fun lol.

<h1 align="center"><strong>🚀 Versions 🚀</strong></h1>

- There are 4 different versions of the Waifu Generator available: 

1. **WaifuGenerator1** Folder ( Uses **Waifu.pics** API ) -- all of it is **SFW** and **NSFW**
2. **WaifuGenerator2** Folder ( Uses **Waifu.pics** API ) -- all of it is **SFW** and **NSFW**
3. **WaifuGenerator3** Folder ( Uses **Waifu.pics** API ) -- all of it is **SFW** and **NSFW**
4. **WaifuGenerator4** Folder ( Uses **Waifu.im** API ) -- all of it is **SFW** and **NSFW**
5. **WaifuGenerator5** Folder ( Uses **nekos.best** API ) -- all of it is **SFW**

<h1 align="center"><strong>⚠️ Important ⚠️</strong></h1>

- Please ensure that you only use either the `index.html` or `main.py` and other files separately. Attempting to use other files together will cause compatibility issues, and the program will not function correctly.

<h1 align="center"><strong>🌟 API 🌟</strong></h1>

- Everything on this repository relies on the **Waifu.pics API**, **Waifu.im API**, and **nekos.best API** but I'm currently searching for an alternative API to make it more diverse.
